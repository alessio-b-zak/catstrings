# catstrings

A web based implementation of a proof assistant based on string diagrams for use in higher category theory.

The underlying implementation is taken from *Data structures for quasistrict higher categories* by *Krzysztof Bar* and *Jamie Vicary* of Oxford Unversity

The current implementation uses purescript to generate HTML and JS to run as a website.

An example of its usage can be found in the `index.html` file in the `dist` folder.
